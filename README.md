# Project Name

This project recreates a one-sided game of guess who. A 'secret person' is selected from a group of 24 characters. The user then asks about the person from a pre-set list of questions and the group are then filtered based on the answer to the question. The user can continue to ask questions until they are ready to guess who the secret person is.

## The problem

I began by reading through the stater code to understand what functions and variables had been preset. I then started from the first function to be called so that one step of the problem was working. Once each step was working I moved on to the next. I worked this week with the 'tigers' group so that we could support each other with finding bugs and optimal ways to write certain lines of code.

The next step is to branch off the functioning game and re-style it. I plan to refactor some code so that I can use it more easily with my new theme (a mushroom themed guess who)
