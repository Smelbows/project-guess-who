# Project Name

This project recreates a one-sided game of guess who but with a mushroom theme. A 'secret mushroom' is selected from a group of 24 mushrooms. The user then asks about the charachteristics from a pre-set list of questions and the group are then filtered based on the answer to the question. The user can continue to ask questions until they are ready to guess what the secret mushroom is.

## The problem

I began by reading through the stater code to understand what functions and variables had been preset. I then started from the first function to be called so that one step of the problem was working. Once each step was working I moved on to the next. I worked this week with the 'tigers' group so that we could support each other with finding bugs and optimal ways to write certain lines of code.

The next step was to branch off the functioning game and re-style it. I refactored some code so that I could use it more easily with my new theme. Once I had this working I focussed on the styling, audio and message counter.
